## Overview

The purpose of the MetabolomicsPipeline is to provide tools for additional analyses to complement the metabolomic analysis done by Metabolon. The MetabolomicsPipeline organizes Metabolon data in a [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html) to allow for easy integration with other packages available on Bioconductor.

Our package also provides functionality for:

1. Loading Metabolon data into a Summarized Experiment (loadMetabolon()) 

2. Exploratory analysis

  - Heatmaps (metabolite_heatmap())
  
  - PCA plots (metabolite_pca())

3. Subpathway analysis (subpathway_analysis())

4. Pairwise Comparisons (metabolite_pairwise())

5. Boxplots and Line plots (subpathway_boxplots() and subpathway_lineplots())

Below is a simple workflow using the MetabolomicsPipeline package.

## Installation

The MetabolomicsPipeline requires R-version >= 4.4.0. 

### Install the release version from Bioconductor
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(version="release")

BiocManager::install("MetabolomicsPipeline")
```

### Install from github
``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
    
 devtools::install_github("datalifecycle-ua/MetabolomicsPipeline", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```



## Getting Started {#sec-GettingStarted}
We demonstrate a workflow using the MetabolomicsPipeline in a vignette.  In this vignette, we use data which consists of 86 samples (42 males, 44 females), three treatment groups, and the samples were taken
at three different time points. We walk through each of the above analyses and demonstrate 
additional functionality for displaying the results. You can view the vignette by using:

```r
browseVignettes("MetabolomicsPipeline")
```
