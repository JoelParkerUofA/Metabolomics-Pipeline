## Overview {#sec-overview}
The purpose of this pipeline is to provide additional analyses to complement the
analysis by Metabolon. In the Metabolon data, each 
"sub-pathway" classifies a collection of metabolites, and each "super-pathway" 
classifies a collection of sub-pathways. The below figure highlights the steps we will be taking, which 
highlight the main modules of this pipeline.

The figure above highlights the five modules in this pipeline 

1. [Peak Normalization and standardization](#peak-normalization-and-standardization-(default=off))

2. [Analysis Data Creation](#analysis-data-creation)

2. Exploratory Peak Analysis

3. Sub-pathway Analysis 

4. Pairwise Comparisons at the metabolite level.

5. Metabolite box plots and line plots within sub-pathways.

## Installation {#sec-Installation}

To download this pipeline, first make sure you have installed devtools.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install Dev tools
install.packages("devtools")
```

Now you can download the pipeline from Git-hub.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Download pipeline from Github
devtools::install_github("JoelParkerUofA/Metabolomics-Pipeline")
```

Once the pipeline has finished downloading, you can open the R project by opening
the "Metabolomic Pipeline.Rproj" to run this pipeline on your local computer. 


## Getting Started {#sec-GettingStarted}

#### Demo Data Set
The workflow comes with a dataset in the Data/Metabolon folder which contains metaboloic
profiles across several treatment groups and time points of ALS in mice. To get started, 
the vignette folder has a file called WorkflowVignette.Rmd. This file walks through
all steps of the pipeline using the ALS data. 

#### Your Own Data
If you have data from Metabolon, you can simply place the .xlsx file from Metabolon
in the "Data/Metabolon" folder and run the "Analysis_data_creation.Rmd" .Rmd file
in the "Code" folder to create the analysis data. Once the analysis data is created,
you can run any of the analysis sections in the "Code" folder independently. 


## renv 
This pipeline utilizes the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#reproducibility)
package to ensure the R environment is consistent for each run. This means that all
of the required packages for this project will be automatically installed within 
the Metabolomics Pipeline project folder. If you are using this pipeline for the 
first time, then use renv::restore() prior to running any of the files. This will
install and update package versions used to generate this pipeline. It should be noted,
this pipeline was generated using R 4.3.1 so if you are using an older version of R, 
then it is possible package versions may not be able to be reinstalled due to dependency
issues. If this is the case we recommend to update your R version to R 4.3.1 or greater. 

## Folder Structure within git-hub
To get started, in the Metabolomics pipeline working directory, there are five 
folders with the following folder structure: 

-   Data
    - Metabolon: Contains the .xlsx file from Metabolon and other files related 
    to the metadata.
    - Processed: Contains data processed from this pipeline. 
-   Code: Contains the .R files of each step of the pipeline.
-   Outputs
    -   Plots
    -   Tables
    -   Reports
- R: Contains and .R file with additional functions used for this pipeline.
- renv: This folder is generated by renv to restore package versions.

You should save the .xlsx file from Metabolon and any additional metadata files 
to the Data/Metabolon folder. The main output folder will contain the plots and 
tables generated from this pipeline. Additionally, you can run this pipeline as 
a report and save it as a .pdf or .html. The report saves to the "Outputs/Reports"
folder.

### Peak Normalization and standardization (Default=OFF)
Since Metabolome provides peak normalization and standardization, we recommend
using the normalized peak data from Metabolome rather than "re-normalizing" the
peak data. However,
